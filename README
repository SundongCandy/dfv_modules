Device File-based I/O Virtualization
====================================

Overview
--------

In Unix-like operating systems, everything is abstracted as a file.  'Device
files' are the files that abstract I/O devices. We have built Paradice, a system
that paravirtualizes I/O devices at the device file boundary. The modules here,
released under the code name 'Device File-based I/O Virtualization (DFV)',
implement the core functionalities used in Paradice. You can find more details
on the design and performance of Paradice in our ASPLOS'14 paper:

Paravirtualization at the Device File Boundary," in Proc. ACM ASPLOS, March
2014.
